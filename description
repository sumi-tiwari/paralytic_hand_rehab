> Empowering Recovery – A smart, low-cost wearable device designed to assist patients with paralytic hand conditions through AI-driven therapy, soft robotics, and gamified engagement.


 Short Description

The **Paralytic Hand Rehabilitation Device** is a wearable smart glove designed to aid in physiotherapy for individuals with hand paralysis. It incorporates flex sensors, soft robotic actuators, and AI-based feedback to promote active recovery. The device is affordable, portable, and customizable to fit individual patient needs. A complementary web interface educates users and logs data for progress tracking.

 Features

- AI-driven Rehabilitation with movement pattern recognition
- Soft Robotics for gentle and adaptive hand support
- Flex Sensor Integration for finger position monitoring
- Gamified Therapy to encourage engagement and faster recovery
- Lightweight & Portable glove design with strip batteries
- Website Interface for user education, logs, and progress


 Hardware Components

| Component                 | Quantity |
|---------------------------|----------|
| Arduino Nano/Uno          | 1        |
| Flex Sensors (per finger) | 5        |
| Servo Motors / Actuators  | 5        |
| Soft Material (Glove)     | 1        |
| Strip Batteries / Power   | 1        |
| Jumper Wires              | —        |
| Breadboard / PCB          | 1        |


 How It Works

1. Finger Movement Detection: Flex sensors detect the bending of each finger.
2. Motor Actuation: Based on the desired therapy routine, actuators help fingers move.
3. Feedback Loop: The system provides haptic feedback and progress info.
4. Gamified Sessions: Patients perform tasks in a game-like interface to motivate continuous use.
5. AI Analysis (Future): Patterns of movement and recovery trends can be used to adapt therapy dynamically.



 How to Set Up and Run


1. Open `arduino/rehab_glove.ino` in the Arduino IDE.
2. Connect flex sensors to analog pins and servos to PWM pins.
3. Upload the code to the board.
4. Monitor movement readings via Serial Monitor.


1. Navigate to `website/` folder.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser to explore the device interface.
3. (Optional) Integrate real-time data visualization using Firebase, Blynk, or Node
